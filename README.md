Discord usertoken bruteforcing program.

Just put your bot token where it needs to be in ASPD-ChaosBrute.py and then to execute:
- open the file "ASPD-ChaosBrute.py" or open a terminal and type "python3 ASPD-ChaosBrute.py"

For ethical purposes.

Only download one. If you get "ChaosBrute.py make sure to put your token in a .env file like so. "TOKEN = <token here>"
